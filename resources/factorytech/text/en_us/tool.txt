$title Safety Gear
Hard hats, safety vests, work pants, and steel-toed boots can be crafted for protection from monsters. The set is functionally identical to iron armour, but it looks much more appropriate for engineers.

$brief %rednotifier% Signals Redstone Watchers.
$brief %redwatcher% Listens for a linked Notifier to be signalled.
Right-click a Redstone Notifier with a Redstone Watcher to link the two. Once linked, the Watcher will light up in your inventory if the Notifier is receiving a Redstone signal.

$title Pressure Gun
The Pressure Gun uses filled tanks of fluid as a weapon. It has different range, damage, and knockback depending on the contents of the tank, detailed on the next page.
It doesn't seem to affect squids at all - in fact, it almost seems like it was designed by them.
