When you get the ability to make Blaze Rods, Make 3 Blaze Rods.
This is due to needed 3 Brewing Stands - 1 is needed for the Alchemical Imbuer, 2 are needed for Alchemical Catalyst from Botania, which can then help in making items eaiser like Gunpowder.

Or if feeling brave make 5 Brewing stands instead of making 3, it will take a bit longer but with the extra 2 Brewing stands make an extra Alchemical Catalyst, this will help later with making a Conjuration catalyst which will double certian items when you unlock the ability of using the Elven Portal which is used in making the items needed to make the conjuration catalyst.

Helpful tip for making Alchemical Imbuer - 2 Fire Runes and 32 sulfur to make enough Pyrotheum which can the be seperated with the centrifugal seperator into enough blaze powder to make the blaze rod needed in a Compactor.
