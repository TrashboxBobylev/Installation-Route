	text: [
		"With help of terrasteel and signalum, you can create small gadgets that can send signals over configured triggers.",
		"",
		"It can be done with regular redstone or specialized pipe wires, designed to fit in same space as gates.",
		"",
		"There is many different triggers, however they can be split into several categories: signal-related, triggers related to type of pipe and other triggers, like mana burst.",
		"",
		"You can upgrade gates with various plates, increasing their efficiency and capacity."
