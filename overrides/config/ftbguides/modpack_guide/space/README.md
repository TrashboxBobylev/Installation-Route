When using the Terminal from Thermal Logistics make sure to have your itemducts be the Impluse item ducts so you wont have to wait for you items to arrive to you when you request them.

Also having the Signalium Plated Itemducts be upgraded to Signalium Plated Impulse Itemducts means waiting for your items to enter your storage wont be as long - as implused item ducts transfer items faster, you only have to use as much signalium plated item ducts as far as the machines is connected  - this will save on power drain for filling up there RF buffer, then you can connect with normal impulse item ducts as the transfer of items will still be as fast.

Also Signalium Plated Fluidducts will also help as well - Fluid and Power at the same time.
