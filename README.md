# Installation Route

**Installation Route** is "master mode" modpack, focused on automation in limited space.

**"Master mode"** means than difficulty of overall progression is set beyond most of expert packs, escalates quickly and relies on logistical puzzles and challenges rather than recipe dumps.

This thing is set under [Botania License](http://botaniamod.net/license.php).

**Overview(_from curseforge, read more there_)**
* This pack can run on 1 GB of RAM and an average processor. Fun ~~is~~ for everyone!

* While being a skyblock, Installation Route features a completely new way of acquiring resources - limited fabricators! Those little things generate infinite amount of a specific resource, but it does it on fixed rate, meaning that you are always in danger of running out of materials to make your next project.

* Quests are present, but there aren't as many as you might expect!  The pack strives to be conservative, but exhaustive.
* Thermal Expansion and Botania have been integrated, so expect many changes there!  The new gimmick of TE is the _lack of energy storage_ on its machines, if they run out of power, they will halt almost immediately!
* Item transportation got harder!  You don't have AE2 or RS for easy autocrafting and storage, so you'll need to learn Corporea basics, Thermal Logistics, and Buildcraft gates!

* A lot of fun and complicated recipes will exist, like *Terrasteel*, *runes*, *midgame machines*, and a bunch of other things, like the fearsome *Ultimate Ingot*

* *Tons* of custom blocks and items have been created, ranging from fancy materials to tools!  

* The progression of Installation Route is split into several chapters, named Parts.  They are separated by doing big projects, involving big amount of resources and time to complete. There are *3 main Parts* and one optional Part with fun content like money and personal computers!  More will be added in the future

* **Mob Spawning** is completely under your control and you don't need to worry about hunger.  Just keep going at this modpack that tests your logistical thinking!

* Two Extended Crafting tables got rebranded into **Engineering Table** and **DNA Project Table**.   The former allows you to massively cut costs for valuable automation components and is needed for endgame recipes, while the latter is needed to spawn most of mobs by writing their DNA and replicating it!

* Craft the **Reality Breaker** to escape the box that was holding you you since beginning and experience the real world!
