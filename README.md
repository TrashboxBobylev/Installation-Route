# Installation Route

**Installation Route** is "master mode" modpack, focused on automation in limited space.

**"Master mode"** means than difficulty of overall progression is set beyond most of expert packs, escalates quickly and relies on logistical puzzles and challenges rather than recipe dumps.

This thing is set under [Botania License](http://botaniamod.net/license.php).

## Textures credits
